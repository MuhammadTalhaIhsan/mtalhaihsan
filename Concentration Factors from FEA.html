							<p class="project-page-p">The assessment of the stress concentration factors is very relevant in mechanical engineering especially structural mechanics, since in the process of design different structures and their ability to withstand different loads are predicted. These factors show that stress increases especially at such places as notches, holes or fillets since local stresses are often higher than overall stresses in a structure. It is, however, important to identify concentration factors correctly so as to determine failure criticalities and to improve the lifetimes and dependability of mechanical components. Engineers can then proceed with the designs of the components using the information on stress concentrations to make sure the respective components can tackle some conditions without failing.</p>
							<p class="project-page-p">In this project, one will find that the author identified a stepped shaft with fillets, for which a Finite Element Analysis, according to the Finnish method, provides the stress concentration factor. The shaft footprint reduces from 25mm to 50mm in diameter with filleting of 2.5 mm and 7.5 mm. An applied torque of 1 kN·m is the couple acting on the shaft and a simulation of the stress response is done using ANSYS Workbench. Finally, the aim of the evaluation is to look into the comparison of the FEA results with theoretical data derived from Peterson’s Stress Concentration Factors chart as to establish its correlation.</p>
							<p class="project-page-p">The main objectives of this assessment are to identify the TSCs for various fillet radii using Peterson’s chart and to perform the FEA to analyse the stress gradient. So, this investigation demonstrates that FEA should be used in conjunction with the previously well-developed theoretical approaches to stress concentration quantification. Using such comparisons does not only justify the outputs of the simulation but also helps in choosing the best structural designs that give out better performance and safety factors.</p>
